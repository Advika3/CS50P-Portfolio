# CS50P-Portfolio

This repository contains some of my solutions to **CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)**.  
I completed these problem sets (upto Week 1) to learn Python basics, problem-solving, and programming best practices. 
Alongside the problem sets, I also experiment and build small projects on my own to deepen my understanding.
I am currently progressing through Week 2 of the course.
